<p>I have folder for 3 coding sites that I used to practice coding. In the paragraphs below I will have the question for each problem.</p><br>
<br>
<p>The first problem I did was on code wars. The question was "A hero is on his way to the castle to complete his mission. However, he's been told that the castle is surrounded with a couple of powerful dragons! each dragon takes 2 bullets to be defeated, our hero has no idea how many bullets he should carry.. Assuming he's gonna grab a specific given number of bullets and move forward to fight another specific given number of dragons, will he survive?

Return true if yes, false otherwise :)" The solution is in the code wars folder</p>
