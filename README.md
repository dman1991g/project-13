<p>I have folders for 3 coding sites that I used to practice coding. In the paragraphs below I will have the question for each problem.</p><br>
<br>
<p>The first problem I did was on code wars. The question was "A hero is on his way to the castle to complete his mission. However, he's been told that the castle is surrounded with a couple of powerful dragons! each dragon takes 2 bullets to be defeated, our hero has no idea how many bullets he should carry.. Assuming he's gonna grab a specific given number of bullets and move forward to fight another specific given number of dragons, will he survive?

Return true if yes, false if he doesn't have enough:)" The solution is in the code wars folder</p><br>
<br>
<p> The second problem was also on code wars and involved sorting the numbers in an array and then adding the two smallest numbers together. The problem was "Create a function that returns the sum of the two lowest positive numbers given an array of minimum 4 positive integers. No floats or non-positive integers will be passed." The solution is in the code wars folder in the file named sumtwosmallestintegers.</p><br>
<br>
<p> The final problem I did was creating a function to sort an array and return the value of the lowest integer. The solution I came up with is in the code wars folder in the file named findsmallestintegerinthe array.</p>
